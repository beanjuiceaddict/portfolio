        <h4>About</h4>
       <p> I am a new to the front-end web development/design field!
         I'm computer literate. I have been working with technology from a very young age!
          At around age 12, I began troubleshooting and helping family and friends set up their inernet modems, their email accounts and even set up thieir new electronics. 
          I've helped install software and programs into computers and whatnot. I've done a little bit of everything. 
          I was not able to attend College or University due to a tough financial situation, however I came across a Coursera advertisement and thought I'd give it a shot!
          I was interested in IT Support BUT came across the Web Design & Development specialization and fell in love! I want to gain experience and do this for a living! 
          Being a perfectionist makes it difficult but absolutely adds to the quality of my work. Some people do not like to hire people with no experience, however I believe it is a great opportunity for you and your company.
          You are able to mold that person to how you like things done. Especially someone like me, a super fast learner!
           I am determined to succeed and put my new abilities to use! I'm thrilled and eager to work with you!
